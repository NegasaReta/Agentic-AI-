Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. It includes sources such as sunlight, wind, the movement of water, and geothermal heat. Although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not. For example, some biomass sources are considered unsustainable at current rates of exploitation.

Main benefits of renewable energy include:
- Reduced carbon emissions and air pollution.
- Enhanced energy security by diversifying energy supplies.
- Economic development and job creation in manufacturing, installation, and more.
- Reduced dependence on imported fuels.

Solar energy, specifically, allows for decentralized power generation, which is crucial for remote areas.
